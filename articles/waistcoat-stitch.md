# Mastering the Waistcoat Stitch

The **Waistcoat Stitch** (also known as the Knit Stitch) is one of my favorite techniques for creating a sturdy, "knit-look" fabric using only a crochet hook. 

### Why use this stitch?
* **Strength:** It creates a very dense fabric, perfect for baskets.
* **Aesthetics:** It looks almost identical to the "V" in knitting.
* **Warmth:** Great for hats and thick sweaters.

### Pro-Tip
Keep your tension **loose**. Because you are inserting the hook into the "V" of the stitch below rather than the top loops, it can get tight very quickly!
